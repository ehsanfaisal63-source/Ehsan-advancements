/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset implements a security model with two primary access levels: user-owned data and administrator-only data. The model prioritizes security by default, ensuring that users can only access their own information, while a separate, explicitly defined group of administrators can manage global application settings.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Each user has a profile document stored under their unique Firebase Authentication UID. All data within this path is considered private to that user.
 * - /authorizationDomains/{domainId}: A top-level collection containing configuration data (authorized domains) that is readable and writable only by administrators.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: A special collection that functions as an access control list. The existence of a document in this collection grants the corresponding user administrator privileges across the application.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict User Ownership: Access to any document under `/users/{userId}` is strictly limited to the authenticated user whose UID matches the `userId` in the path.
 * - Database-Based Access Control (DBAC): Administrator status is not stored in custom claims but is determined by checking for the existence of a document in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` path. This allows for dynamic, database-driven role management.
 * - Admin Collection Lockdown: The `/roles_admin` collection itself is locked down from all client-side read and write operations. This is a critical security measure to prevent users from escalating their own privileges. Admin roles must be granted server-side or via the Firebase Console.
 * - Deny by Default: Any path not explicitly matched is inaccessible. Permissions for each operation (get, list, create, update, delete) are explicitly defined.
